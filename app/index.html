      <p class="info-personal">Being a developer- and designer-hybrid I like to know a bit about everything. I am eager to learn and thrive on challenges forcing me to expand my skillset. When I get to work on things I’m good at, I become very passionate and tend to leave out everything else until I’m satisfied with the outcome. I pay attention to details and put a great amount of honor in optimizing and tweaking all the little things that in total makes an even better and faster product. Contrary to my profession I enjoy being active and pushing myself and my body towards new goals. I believe that the only way to be truly happy is to continuously accomplish and set new goals - both personally and professionally.</p>

            At this point I felt things were running pretty well; I was almost a webdeveloper-graduate, I had a nice fulltime job as a webdeveloper, and I LOVED Copenhagen. So I decided to make the joy more permanent by buying my first apartment and moving closer to the city.

          <div class="event-description">This is the time where I could finally say I had a proper education – although most of my knowledge was gained through my job. I finished my education by doing a 6-month project for my employer, building a website management system for managing user-access and FTP-credentials for their huge list of domains. The system was based on the MVC-concept and built with PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.</div>

            In my sparetime I like to exercise and keep myself fit so when I got the opportunity to join a newly founded Kickboxing-club and help them get successful I immediately said yes. After that I spent the next 2 years being in charge of their website, creating promotional material and function as accountant.
